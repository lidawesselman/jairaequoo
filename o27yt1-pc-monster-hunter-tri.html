I've tried setting speed limit to 200% so it runs at 60fps instead of 30. The problem is, the game runs too fast and the audio is also fast. Has anyone tried playing MHTri at 60fps settings with normal audio? Or is it impossible? Thanks in advance! Using Dolphin 5.0 with Win 10 amp GTX 1050 RoG Strix Edition.

Hey guys, amp#x200B; We just begun playing Monster Hunter World on PC with my friend. We both have some experience from previous titles of the Monster Hunter series (MHF 2, MH Tri) but it's been a few years now. As we both love that game - and gaming together - we have a "contract" : we can play alone, but no progressing though the story or monsters. We do every new thing together. Right now we reached Pukei-Pukei (https://monsterhunterworld.wiki.fextralife.com/Pukei-Pukei) 
ampnbsp;ampnbsp;ampnbsp;ampnbsp;I'm on my third play through of this game, this time on PC and primarily solo. I decided to play exclusively HBG and had been rocking the "facetank everything with shields" build in preparation for Behemoth. It's been a while since any of my friends had played, so when I hit HR 49, I groaned internally. I knew this was not going to be a fun fight, and I was going to be relying on randoms at best. ampnbsp;ampnbsp;ampnbsp;ampnbsp;I geared  Hey all. Long-time Hunter here. Sorry in advance for the long post. I don't even know how many (or if any) people will see this to begin with, but I was just looking for some input on the ways I've been playing this game over the years. I know there's no real objectively correct or incorrect way of playing Monster Hunter—or any game, for that matter—but I've been questioning if my play-style has been too "Drawn out".

Hi Everyone, I wanted to know if you all had any advice for better optimization? I play a decent amount of Monster Hunter, some FPS games, Civ V, WoW, Skyrim. I'd really like to get some gains in screen resolution and render distance. My budget is around ~0. If there's no clear bottleneck I plan on just replacing some(?) of the older parts of my build (my RAM is ancient, PSU is second besides an old HDD that I don't put anything on) or newer headphones or mouse as those Hello everyone, I started having this problem a year ago which I temporarily fixed by uninstalling the Radeon Software. Yesterday while playing Monster Hunter World the problem has recurred. I noticed that the Radeon Software was installed and I uninstalled it again but it didn't fix the problem. The strange thing is that I played other games and the same game a month ago and there were no problems. The max temperature while playing is 60° celsius.

Hey there Hunters, my girlfriend lately started playing Monster Hunter World a few days ago and realy liked it so far. It's her fist MH game and the first Action Adventure she ever played. The only problem, I started playing MHW when it was released on PC and started with the series back when Tri was released on the Wii and I'm one of those that think MHW is pretty damn easy compered to the older games. Whenever we play together I have the feeling of carrying to much. I use highrank armor. (Reposting, because I shared my friend code and forgot that the sidebar suggested to avoid sharing such things immediately. Apologies for that mistake.) Hello new friends! Online games I have for the 3DS are Pokémon X, Pokémon Ultramoon, Mario Kart 7, Super Smash Bros., Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate, The Legend of Zelda: Tri Force Heroes, and Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright. I reaaaally want folks with whom to play Tri Force Heroes!
